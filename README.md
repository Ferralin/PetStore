# How to see it
To do this we can enter the github section "code" and clone the repository, then we can go to the gitbash terminal and go to the folder that we are going to clone and with the command git clone "url", we can clone the repository. After having installed intellijIDE, we will proceed to open the project, inside intellijIdea we will go to "file", "open" and we will go to the folder where this cloned project is located. The class we are going to compile is called "AllFeatureTests". This class will compile all the methods together and will generate an html type report. In case we get an error because we have another java version, we can go to the section "edit configurations" and we can proceed to change to java 8 1.8 and in case we do not have this version, we will have to install java 8 version 1.8. Next we are going to see the generated report, for this we have to go to intellijIdea and locate the "target" folder which will be positioned in project in the left panel and we will proceed to expand its options, we will open its folders and we will open the .js folder, then we will locate the .html file called "overview-features.html", we will right click on "open in">"open in browser" and we will choose our browser of preference and this way we will be able to see the generated cucumber report.
